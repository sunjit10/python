Dabbling with Python


## Python Implementations

Python has various implementations. Basically, we have Python Rules and various implementations of those Rules.
CPython is what is Python3 written and based on. This is where any new standards/rules gets implemented first and then other language implementations adopt it.

CPython     - Default Implementation (Python written in C)
Jython      - Java based Python Implementation
IronPython  - C# based Python Implementation
PyPy        - Subset of Python

## How it works

Python Code -> CPython (Python Compiler) -> Python Bytecode

Python Bytecode -> Python Virtual Machine -> Machine Code (Platform specific)
